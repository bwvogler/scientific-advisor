# Building an LLM Agent for a Scientific Advisor

The Scientific Advisor role involves many recurring knowledge work tasks – from summarizing customer data and crafting reports, to tracking project details and answering technical questions. An AI agent can automate “busywork” and surface insights, freeing you to focus on higher-value strategy. For example, AI can auto-summarize meeting notes or customer assays, draft polished emails and reports, and retrieve relevant technical information on demand. The key is to capture and feed the right information into the agent’s **memory** so it learns your clients and projects over time.

## Identify Repetitive Tasks to Automate
List out routine tasks that consume your time. Common examples include:
- **Report and summary drafting:** Generating QBR slides, interpreting model outputs, writing follow-up notes, or summarizing experimental results. Modern LLMs can *instantly* create polished, domain-specific documents and even draft customer-facing emails.
- **Meeting and conversation analysis:** Turning customer calls, Slack threads or emails into actionable summaries. AI-powered meeting summarizers and chat assistants can extract key points or action items from transcripts.
- **Knowledge lookups:** Quickly retrieving background on proteins, assays, or company portfolios. Instead of manual search, an agent with domain knowledge can answer questions about targets, workflows or the Cradle platform on demand.
- **Data quality checks:** Scanning customer data for ML readiness (e.g. format issues or missing values). An agent can apply simple validation rules or highlight anomalies to ensure inputs meet model requirements.
- **Customer insights:** Tracking customer sentiment and risk factors. AI can “track a much wider range of inputs… looking at emails, support tickets, customer conversations” to spot issues early. An agent could scan communications for signs of dissatisfaction or urgency (e.g. customer complaints or declining metrics).

Automating these tasks with an AI copilot shifts “grunt work” to the agent. For example, AI-generated meeting summaries and automated customer health reports can cut down manual admin time, letting you focus on strategy and high-level science.

## Saving Communications and Building Memory
To make the agent smarter over time, **capture and store all relevant communications** and project details. This could include:
- Call and meeting transcripts (via automatic speech-to-text)
- Email threads and Slack conversations
- Project plans, assay protocols, experimental data notes
- Customer feedback and Q&A sessions.

Store these in a structured knowledge base (for example, a vector database) where each “memory” entry is tagged by customer, project and date. Embedding text snippets into a vector store (like Pinecone, Chroma or FAISS) lets the AI retrieve relevant facts later. For instance, you might convert a key sentence (“Customer X needs 50mg of protein per assay”) into an embedding and save it. When you later ask the AI, “What did Customer X say about their dosing?”, the agent can RAG-search the memory store and recall that detail.

This retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach effectively gives the agent **memory**. Over time it can recall each customer’s project history, preferences and past conversations – essentially becoming a “single source of truth” for your customer knowledge. You can even create specialized “AI personas” for different focuses (e.g. a **technical advisor** persona for deep domain research vs. a **communications manager** persona for follow-ups). With memory, the agent can greet contacts by name, remember project goals, and avoid asking for info twice – much like a human assistant.

To implement this:
- Periodically **ingest new communications**: upload emails, call transcripts or meeting notes into the memory database (even as simple text files or PDFs). Tools like LangChain or dedicated memory frameworks can automate embedding new documents.
- Allow **user feedback on memory**: mark which facts are important, correct any mistakes, or delete outdated info, so the agent doesn’t “learn” the wrong things.
- Respect privacy: avoid storing sensitive personal data, or use encryption.

## Core Agent Capabilities
Once memory and knowledge are in place, an LLM agent can support nearly all aspects of the Scientific Advisor role:
- **Content Generation:** Draft presentation slides, technical write-ups or email templates.
- **Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of experiments, customer calls or long documents.
- **Question Answering:** Act as an on-demand advisor.
- **Data Extraction:** Parse structured data or Excel sheets.
- **Recommendation and Strategy:** Offer suggestions based on patterns.
- **CRM/Project Updates:** Automatically update a simple CRM or knowledge repo.
- **Sentiment/Health Analysis:** Monitor feedback.
- **Training & Onboarding:** Answer FAQs and train users interactively.

## Implementation Strategy
Given your strong technical background, you can build this agent iteratively:
1. **Prototype with an LLM + RAG**
2. **Integrate Data Sources**
3. **Build Task Flows**
4. **Create Personas or Modes**
5. **Continuous Learning**
6. **Privacy and Accuracy**

## Ongoing Feedback and Evolution
By capturing communications and codifying repetitive tasks, you build a virtuous cycle: **every email, note or report you feed the agent makes it smarter for next time**. Over weeks, you’ll find it handling more routine work – summarizing customer data, maintaining project plans, and even flagging risks – while you focus on science strategy and growing the relationship.

**Sources:** Modern AI assistant technology and case studies show that LLM-powered agents excel at summarization, drafting communication, knowledge retrieval and strategic suggestions. These capabilities directly map to the Scientific Advisor responsibilities, making an LLM agent a force-multiplier for the role.
